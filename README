This is a collection of small examples illustrating what features Fortran
offers for Object Oriented Programming (and what it does not). All files are
standalone modules or programs and serve mainly the purpose of showing how OOP
features in fortran work, using either abstract examples or use simple use
cases that could appear in numerical code.

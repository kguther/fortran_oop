This is a collection of small examples illustrating what features Fortran
offers for Object Oriented Programming (and what it does not). All files are
standalone modules or programs and serve mainly the purpose of showing how OOP
features in fortran work, using either abstract examples or use simple use
cases that could appear in numerical code.

Objects:
  type_bound.F90  - introduces member functions
  construction.F90 - introduces factories
  finalization.F90 - introduces destructors
  assignment.F90 - operator overloading and copy-assignment
  generic.F90 - generic type bound procedures

Encapsulation:
  encapsulation.F90 - introduces how encapsulation works in Fortran
  encapsulation_split.F90 - better example of how it should be done
  lattice.F90 - use case example for a lattice class consisting of points
  
Polymorphism:
  inheritance.F90 - introduces inheritance
  override.F90 - how to override member functions
  static_override.F90 - how to override static member functions
  polymorphism.F90 - introduces polymorphism
  invalid_assignment.F90 - counterexample for working with polymorphic types
  abstract_type.F90 - introduces abstract base classes
 
Further examples:
  param_type.F90 - parametrized objects (only very limited support)
  select_type.F90 - explicit type deduction
